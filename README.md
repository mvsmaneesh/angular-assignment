# angular-assignment
Created this project as a part of my technical assessment as a front-end developer.

For this project, I have used the latest Angular version (19.2.13)
As mentioned in the assignment, I have created separate components for account creation, transaction processing, and transaction history.

I have already imported the Bootstrap dependency into the application, so I don't think it needs any additional plugins or dependencies while running the application.
